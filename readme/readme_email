There are two ways to receive 'emails' of errors when not in debug mode
The first is to use python's smtplib module to create a debugging session. In a second terminal, run the command 'python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:8025'. Then, 'export MAIL_SERVER=localhost' and 'MAIL_PORT=8025' so that the emails are sent to this localhost
The second is to use python's smtplib module to actually send emails to your chosen email address. Export: ' MAIL_SERVER=smtp.googlemail.com MAIL_PORT=587 MAIL_USE_TLS=1 MAIL_USERNAME=<your-gmail-username> MAIL_PASSWORD=<your-gmail-password>', and the module will send emails to that email address. Some email addresses may not allow emails from this module for security reasons.
Note, for both approaches, we need to unset the FLASK_DEBUG or set it to 0
